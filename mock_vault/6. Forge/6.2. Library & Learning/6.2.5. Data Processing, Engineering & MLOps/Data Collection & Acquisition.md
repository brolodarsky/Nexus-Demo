Data collection is the critical first stage of any Machine Learning project or Agentic Workflow. Without high-quality, relevant, and clean data, even the most advanced Deep Learning models will fail (Garbage In, Garbage Out).

## Core Acquisition Methods

### 1. Web Scraping
Extracting unstructured data directly from websites when an API is not available.
*   **BeautifulSoup (Python):** A library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It is best for static, simple web pages.
*   **Scrapy:** A fast high-level web crawling and web scraping framework, used to crawl websites and extract structured data from their pages.
*   **Playwright / Selenium:** Used when websites are highly dynamic, rely on client-side JavaScript rendering, or require complex browser interactions (like logging in or scrolling). Many modern [[Overview - AI Agents]] use these frameworks under the hood to "browse" the web.

### 2. API Ingestion (Application Programming Interfaces)
The programmatic, structured way to request data from external servers.
*   **REST APIs:** The most common architecture. Data is requested via HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`) and usually returned in JSON format.
*   **GraphQL:** An API query language that allows the client to request *exactly* the data they need and nothing more, reducing over-fetching.
*   **Webhooks:** Unlike polling an API repeatedly, a webhook is a push mechanism where a server sends an HTTP POST request to your application *immediately* when an event occurs.

### 3. Database Extraction
Extracting structured proprietary data from organizational storage.
*   Requires knowledge of [[SQL Overview|SQL]] to extract data from Relational Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL).
*   Connecting to Data Lakes (S3, GCS) or Data Warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery).

## Modern LLM & RAG Ingestion Tools

In the context of [[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)]], raw text data must be acquired, parsed, and embedded before it is useful to an LLM.

*   **Document Loaders:** Libraries within LangChain or LlamaIndex that can ingest PDFs, Word Documents, Notion pages, and Slack channels.
*   **Unstructured.io:** A powerful open-source library specifically designed to ingest and parse complex, messy document formats (like heavily formatted PDFs with tables) into clean JSON for LLM consumption.
*   **Vector DB Ingestion:** Once data is scraped and chunked, it is embedded and ingested into a [[Vector Databases|Vector Database]] for semantic retrieval.

## Data Quality & Compliance

*   **Robots.txt:** When web scraping, ethical practice requires checking the target site's `robots.txt` file to ensure the specific pages allow automated crawling.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Ensuring your ingestion scripts or Agent loops adhere to API rate limits (e.g., max 10 requests per second) to explicitly avoid Denial of Service (DoS) bans.
*   **PII Sanitization:** scrub Personally Identifiable Information (like Social Security Numbers or credit cards) from ingested datasets *before* training a model or storing it in a Vector DB.
