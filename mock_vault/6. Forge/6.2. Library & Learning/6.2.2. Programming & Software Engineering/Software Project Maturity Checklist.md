# Enterprise Project Maturity Checklist

This document serves as a standardized checklist to elevate personal projects into professional, enterprise-grade applications. Apply these practices to any serious program to ensure maintainability, scalability, and collaboration readiness.

## 1. Documentation & Version Control (Implemented in Feeder)
- [ ] **README.md**: Comprehensive guide detailing the project's purpose, features, tech stack, and step-by-step local setup instructions.
- [ ] **CHANGELOG.md**: A chronologically ordered list of notable changes, adhering to the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format.
- [ ] **Conventional Commits**: Standardized Git commit messages (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`) to create readable commit history and automate versioning.
- [ ] **Agent Skills / Enforced Workflows**: Automated rules (like `.agents/skills/enforce-documentation-vcs/SKILL.md`) to remind or force updates to documentation and adherence to commit standards before pushing code.

## 2. Environment & Configuration Management
- [ ] **`.env.example` / `.env.template`**: A template file containing all required environment variables with dummy values, ensuring new developers know exactly what configuration is needed without exposing real secrets.
- [ ] **Secret Scanning**: Implement tools (like GitHub Advanced Security or pre-commit hooks) to prevent accidental commits of API keys or passwords.

## 3. Containerization & Infrastructure
- [ ] **Dockerization (`Dockerfile`)**: Containerize the backend and frontend into isolated environments to guarantee the application runs identically on any machine ("it works on my machine" prevention).
- [ ] **`docker-compose.yml`**: A single command (`docker-compose up`) orchestration file to spin up the entire stack seamlessly, including databases, backend APIs, and frontend clients.

## 4. Automation & CI/CD Pipelines
- [ ] **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automated workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) that trigger on every push/Pull Request to run tests, linters, and build checks. Code cannot be merged if the pipeline fails.
- [ ] **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated checks that run *before* `git commit` succeeds, enforcing code formatting (e.g., Black/Ruff for Python, Prettier for JS), linting, and catching common errors.
- [ ] **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automated deployment to staging or production environments once the CI pipeline passes and code is merged to the main branch.

## 5. Developer Experience (DX) & Standardization
- [ ] **Makefile / Task Runner**: Abstract complex, multi-step commands into standard, cross-platform shortcuts (e.g., `make run`, `make test`, `make generate-client`).
- [ ] **Cross-Stack Type Safety**: Tools like `openapi-typescript-codegen` (Implemented in Feeder) or tRPC to automatically generate frontend types from backend schemas, preventing API drift.
- [ ] **Issue & Pull Request Templates**: Standardized `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` and `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` markdown files to enforce structured bug reporting and PR checklists.

## 6. Testing Strategy
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Isolated testing of individual functions and components (e.g., Pytest, Jest).
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Testing how different parts of the system interact (e.g., API endpoints hitting testing databases).
- [ ] **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Simulating real user interactions using tools like Cypress or Playwright.

## 7. Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] **Error Tracking**: Integration with platforms like Sentry or LogRocket to automatically capture user-facing errors, stack traces, and environment details in production.
- [ ] **Structured Logging**: Moving beyond `print()` statements to structured, leveled logging (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR) that can be easily parsed by log aggregators.
- [ ] **Health Check Endpoints**: Dedicated routes (e.g., `/api/health`) for orchestration tools (like Kubernetes or load balancers) to verify the application is live and communicating with its database.

## 8. Maintenance & Operations (Ops)
- [ ] **Silent Maintenance Debt Audit**: A scheduled routine (e.g., quarterly) to check for "engine rot", including orphaned files, broken IDs, or redundant database entries.
- [ ] **Dependency Pinning & Updates**: Ensuring all dependencies are version-pinned (e.g., `requirements.txt` with strict versions or `uv.lock`) and establishing a routine (e.g., Dependabot) for keeping them secure and updated.
- [ ] **API Deprecation Checks**: Regularly auditing third-party APIs (like OpenAI models, Stripe endpoints) for sunsetting or end-of-life (EOL) announcements to avoid sudden breakage.
- [ ] **Data Schema & Index Drift**: Monitoring changes in data shapes or notes over time. If structural elements change, planning for mandatory data migrations/re-indexing rather than silent degradation.
