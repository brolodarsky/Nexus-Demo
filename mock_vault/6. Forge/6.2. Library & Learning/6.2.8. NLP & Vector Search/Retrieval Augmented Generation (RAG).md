**Back to:** [[Table of Contents#6.2.8. NLP & Vector Search|TOC]]

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique for enhancing Large Language Models by fetching relevant external data and inserting it into the model's context window before generating a response. It grounds the LLM in specific, up-to-date, or proprietary data that was not present in its original training corpus.

## The Core Concept

LLMs are frozen in time based on their training data. When asked about recent events or private company data, they will hallucinate or fail.
*   **The Problem:** Fine-tuning an entire model on new data is expensive, slow, and doesn't solve the problem of real-time updates or dynamic access control.
*   **The Solution:** Instead of *training* the model to memorize the data, *provide* the data to the model explicitly right before it answers the user's question.

## The Standard RAG Pipeline

A typical RAG pipeline involves three main steps, commonly referred to as "Ingestion," "Retrieval," and "Generation."

### 1. Ingestion (Data Processing)
*   **Parsing:** Extracting text from PDFs, Notion docs, codebases, or websites.
*   **Chunking:** Breaking long documents down into smaller, semantically meaningful pieces (chunks, e.g., 500-1000 tokens). If chunks are too large, the specific information gets lost; if too small, context is lost.
*   **Embedding:** Converting each chunk of text into a [[Vector Embeddings|mathematical vector]] (a list of numbers) that represents its semantic meaning.
*   **Vector Database:** Soring these embeddings (and the original text) in a specialized database like [[Milvus]] or Pinecone for fast similarity search.

### 2. Retrieval 
*   **Query Embedding:** When a user asks a question, their query is converted into a vector using the *exact same embedding model* used during ingestion.
*   **Vector Search:** The system quickly searches the Vector Database for the chunks whose vectors are mathematically closest (most similar) to the query vector.
*   **Context Assembly:** The top `K` most relevant chunks are retrieved.

### 3. Generation
*   **The Prompt:** The retrieved chunks are injected into the context window alongside the user's original question and the system prompt.
    *   *Example Prompt:* "Answer the user's question using ONLY the following context. If the answer is not in the context, say 'I don't know'.\n\nContext:\n[Chunk 1]\n[Chunk 2]\n\nQuestion: [User's Question]"
*   **Response Synthesis:** The LLM reads the context and generates an informed, factual response.

## Advanced RAG Techniques

Basic RAG (Naïve RAG) often fails on complex queries. Advanced techniques include:

*   **Query Transformations (Routing/Rewriting):** Using an LLM to rewrite the user's query to optimize it for vector search (e.g., expanding abbreviations or writing multiple sub-queries).
*   **Semantic Router:** Deciding *which* database or RAG pipeline to use based on the intent of the query.
*   **Re-ranking (Cross-Encoders):** Filtering down a large list of retrieved chunks using a slower, more accurate model (like Cohere Rerank) to ensure only the absolute best context reaches the final LLM pass.
*   **Graph RAG:** Combining traditional vector search with Knowledge Graphs to retrieve information based on relational connections rather than just semantic similarity.

## Critical Considerations (The "Important Shit")

*   **The Model/Tokenizer Marriage:** The model used for retrieval and the tokenizer used for chunking **must** be compatible. If you use OpenAI's tokenizer with a Llama-based embedding model, your chunk limits will be inaccurate, and search quality will suffer.
*   **The Re-indexing Burden:** Vectors are mathematically specific to the model that created them. If you change your embedding model, you **must re-index your entire dataset.** You cannot search for an OpenAI vector against a Nomic vector.
*   **Matryoshka Embeddings:** Modern models (like `text-embedding-3-small`) allow you to truncate your vectors (e.g., from 1536 to 512 dimensions) to save disk space and compute without significant accuracy loss.
*   **Context Window Drift:** As models support 128k+ tokens, "Naïve RAG" is less about *fitting* data and more about *guiding* the model to the exact factual needle in the haystack.

## RAG Operations (RAGOps) & Maintenance

Building a RAG system is a day-one task; maintaining its accuracy is a day-365 task. Common "decay" patterns include:

*   **The Path-Identity Trap:** If files are renamed or moved, the Vector Database often keeps the "orphaned" vectors pointing to the old paths. This leads to duplicate/broken citations.
*   **Prompt Drift:** Updates to the underlying LLM (e.g., GPT-4o → GPT-5) can change how the model interprets grounding instructions. Prompts must be re-evaluated after any base-model update.
*   **Metadata Schema Drift:** If you add new filtering needs (e.g., "only search notes from last month") but didn't index the `date` field during ingestion, you must re-index the entire dataset to enable that filter.
*   **Semantic Fragility:** Over time, your note-taking style might change, making old chunking strategies (e.g., "split by H2") less effective for new, denser notes.

## Popular Tools & Frameworks

*   **[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/):** A more general-purpose LLM orchestration framework that includes RAG components.
*   **Embedding Models:** OpenAI (`text-embedding-3-small`), BGE, Cohere.
